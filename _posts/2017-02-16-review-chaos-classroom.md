Chapter 1: The authors draw connections between all these terms in chaos theory and the way the mind works quite neatly. I’ll grant we’re complicated beings whose consciousnesses arise from possibly-messy processes. The initial conditions indeed matter. Learning is nonlinear. We can’t expect to achieve a neat result with our linear teaching. Sure. But are you implying that linear teaching won’t achieve a good result? I can’t tell. It seems that true that when chaotic conditions in the manner described exist, critical thinking is likely to take place. The analogies are useful, but I’m not really sure chaos theory and this learning thing being described are /that/ close to one another.

Chapter 2:  I agreed and the ideas were simple enough, but seems like a basic level repeat of chapter one sans terminology?

Chapter 3: Some decent examples of what is meant by a standard linear classroom, a chaotic classroom, and a random classroom. I don’t remember classroom conversations being that teacher-driven and stifling, though. Is this what is meant by linear teaching? In that case, I think few would disagree… I felt my classes were always more like the ‘chaotic’ system. Maybe I had good teachers. An interesting point: chaotic dynamics is not the same as randomness – but I’m missing the key difference in concrete form. What exactly differentiates them in implementation? How does one avoid the ‘chaos’ of randomness most would have imagined when considering the title?

Chapter 4: I find myself floundering for a better intuition or catastrophe shelf, despite the examples given. Some  examples weren’t that great (I didn’t really see the point of the storybook one besides that it was a very fuzzy sort of teaching) but I found the ‘share initial idea independently -> choose a few to defend/present in small groups -> discuss again as a whole group, which evolves naturally into deeper conversation’ was a nice, simple, implementable method.

Chapter 5 (and final): I realized the examples given were largely humanities-based classrooms. Overall, the connections with chaos were there, but as mentioned when talking about Ch1, I feel some ideas deserve to be developed in an independent context with its own new terminology. Ultimately it ended up reading more like defense of a thesis  (e.g. in lit: come up with a crazy link between book and X idea, provide evidence) than innovation of a new standalone theory, or even fully demonstrating/defending the point (lack of well-reasoned counters besides straw-man examples of linear teaching). Still, the idea was worth thinking about. I just wish I got it in a more concise form.
