For coursework at Woodrow Wilson the other day, we sat down to design our [“teacher personas“](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Crafting-a-Teaching-Persona/46671). It’s a pretty common idea in education that your teacher-face doesn’t need to be all of you [or even particularly close to your “true self”](https://www.edutopia.org/discussion/teachers-persona-or-personality-which-more-important).

As usual, we used the tool [innovator’s compass](http://www.olin.edu/the-wire/2018/the-innovators-compass-finds-its-way/) to do our design, “goal-oriented” work. For step 0, you place the user in the center (in this case, my teacher persona and my future students. Easy enough. Then, you fill out the remaining quadrants in the following order:

1. Observations: write down concrete examples of good and bad outcomes. Do not start analyzing them; just describe the events. Here, the question in my head was, “when did I notice that my teacher was good? when did I feel like I was learning as a student?”
	* As a student: I noticed (and asked) my own questions. I had “aha” moments of connection, e.g. realizing Polaris doesn’t move. I was proud of final products like Hamlet acting and any Blatz paper. I laughed during groupwork with friends. I worked on things I wouldn’t normally try and took on extra, surprisingly creative projects for fun (Blatz, Lee). I actually expressed myself (pridie, letter to Harris). I could turn around and feel ready to teach the class (unlike in college).
	* Noticing my teachers: Harris, Wrabel, Blatz, Gaida, Lee-, Henderson-, Song-, Rupprecht-
2. Principles: generalize from your observations. What can I abstract away from the examples? (Granted, my examples failed to be perfectly concrete. Oops.)
	* On the student side: it’s nice to be curious, to try new things and push comfort zones. It’s nice not to have a single clear goal to surpass, then sit around bored. It’s nice to have fun. It’s nice to see the big picture.
	* On the teacher side: there were clear expectations and routines. In some senses, the teachers had fairly “strong” characters; they’re easily caricature-able (even if that caricature is complex…) They presented ideas clearly, and are strong lecturers. It was “obvious” what the important parts were. They are very with-it/engaged during the whole class period.
	* On both sides: students and teachers alike *believe in what they’re doing* (!)
3. Ideas: brainstorm. how can one bring those principles into real life?
4. Experiment: scale that idea down to a 5-minute, $5 exercise. How did it go?

Except I never quite got to steps (3) and (4). Thinking about (3), my brain came up with stuff like “have open ended, flexibly graded projects that let students express themselves how they want”…before realizing this basically only applied to English. I did a double take and thought about my favorite teachers. And indeed, they were all English teachers. Hm.

I tried to come up with examples of good STEM teachers. What did they do? They packaged the material neatly, and I understood it.

Umm…

Is that what I want to do? Why can’t I just record videos of myself doing this? Turns out, I just love English – how did I end up in STEM at all??

If I look a little more deeply, I remember some fun activities from bio class in 9th grade, and nothing special in chem or physics. Some demos have been pretty cool (cough Wrabel’s candle, Thun/psych in general), but mostly it was just rote memorization that wasn’t applicable to real life. The parts I love and am passionate about are the meta-science: how good science is done; what biases we have; how we can overcome them; the pursuit of knowledge done right; good epistemics!

What makes a good STEM teacher? Ideas & thoughts are welcome…



[Addendum 1: After this activity, I remembered that part of my goal in taking another year of edschool was to learn about inquiry-based biology, but I’m in a biology classroom where no labs happen. Oops. At least I’ll have learned what it’s like to work with a lower-achieving population.]

[Addendum 2: Filling out my innovator’s compass, I was also surprised at the discrepancy between what education classes have told me and what I actually believe. Don’t lecture, they say. Make exit tickets. Get feedback from your students. These aren’t the traits that my favorite teachers had – in fact, some of these were outright contradicted by their practices.]

[Addendum 3: Some ideas I ended up generating were: lecture for 20 minutes, “free/flex time” for the rest; don’t give homework beyond audio recording you and possible friends talking about the material for 5 minutes; “do interesting labs and activities”; lecture well; figure out how to bridge the big picture with vocab drilling.]
