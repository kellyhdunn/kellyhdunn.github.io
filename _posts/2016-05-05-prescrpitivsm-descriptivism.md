Being pedantic is often looked down upon. And with good enough reason.

In 24.900, one of the first things we learned was the difference between different schools of linguistics (explained here rather sillily). We were all told to be descriptivists, or at the very least, told that prescriptivism was a very wrong way to go about things. I agree, from an objective/rational point of view, but was ultimately someone who regarded herself as a prescriptivist at heart (and still very much does, at least when it comes to syntax – diction is entirely a different matter).

A few examples. The mouseover text of this xkcd bothers me – couple is two, few is three, many is somewhat more than that and several is more still. The English distinct subjunctive form – “if I were you” (as opposed to “if I was you”) is certainly dying, but I insist enough upon it. Putting prepositions at the end of sentences is perfectly fine, and rules claiming otherwise are silly, but I would still tend to decline “who” into “whom” when it’s not in the nominative. Magma is underground, lava isn’t. “Literally” used to mean what it does now is questionable at best.

Yes, I believe I am self-aware, and know my rules are foolish, or altogether inconsistent.

There is, though, merit to some degree of pedantry. Terminology is relevant; having a common basis from which discussion can be begun is necessary. Why have a term distinguishing rocks currently in space from those that have fallen to the floor? It’s more efficient. To participate in the conversation, you need to have the vocabulary, and invest some amount of effort to learn it. There’s some link to 24.904 (language acquisition) here, something learned in conjunction with the Baesian models of word acquisition and such. But I dropped that class, so I can’t speak to it further. That’s me: rambling about stuff I don’t know anything about.
